But until now, it hasn’t been possible to evaluate and compare it in a meaningful way—not to mention add to it, improve it, or weigh in on its importance.</p>\r\n<p>WikiRate.org is a place where everyone—individuals, advocacy groups, researchers, and companies themselves—can bring together information from a variety of sources and make it useful.

We want to measure companies' social and environmental performance so that concerned citizens</span><span> can make a fair comparison between them and support companies they consider \"better\".  </span><span>If we can make a company's impacts known in a way that affects their profitability, this will push them to behave more responsibly. </span></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>We're gathering <strong>better information about [[companies]] </strong>and<strong> creating</strong><strong> better [[metrics]] and [[Overview]]</strong>, so <strong>anyone can compare companies</strong>, and ultimately<strong> drive companies to better themselves</strong>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>What does \"better\" mean? What does it mean to you? On WikiRate you can say what [[topics]] and [[metrics]] are important to you.  Your preferences will prioritize relevant content for you and will also contribute to a community vote on what matters most. Those votes will, in turn, determine what appears most prominently on the site and what information companies are most strongly urged to make public.</p>\r\n<p>Like any community, we're made up of people with lots of different values. But <strong>our community is united by the idea that by making companies more understandable and more transparent, we can make them more accountable to their stakeholders</strong>: community members, employees, investors, customers, and anyone else effected by a company's choices.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h1><span>{{+vision video|float:right; margin:0px 18px}}</span>Better Metrics</h1>\r\n<p><span>On the right of every [[Company]] page you'll see a list of social and environmental [[Metrics]].  These aren't part</span><span> of a preconceived ratings system, they're community contributions.  WikiRate provides a ratings </span><em>framework</em><span> where </span><strong>community members design, discuss, populate, and vote on [[Metrics]] to standardize measurements of a company's performance. </strong><span> </span><span> </span><span>Metrics can include low-level indicators (like employee counts or emission measurements), high-level ratings (like a human rights score), or anything in between.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>At present, all the values for these Metrics are directly entered by community members, either manually or via structured data imports.  Every directly entered value must cite a [[Source]]. Soon it will also be possible for community members to recombine the metrics to create new ones dynamically using mathematical and graphical tools.</span> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h1>Better Overviews</h1>\r\n<p><span>On the left of every [[Company]] page you'll see a list of [[Topics]] like [[Climate Change]], [[Human Rights]], and [[Political Accountability]]. </span><strong>Community members write [[Overview]] connecting specific [[Companies]] to these [[Topics]]</strong><span>. As on most wikis, [[Overview]]</span><em><strong> </strong></em><span>are community-edited, but Wikirate has an advanced citation system to make sure the overviews are trustworthy and well-sourced. [[Overview]] must cite [[Note]], which are short, simple sourced statements about companies. [[Note]], in turn, must cite [[Sources]].</span><em><strong> </strong></em><span></span><span>The community openly discusses and votes on both [[Note]] and [[Sources]] to determine their importance. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>[[Source]] data for both metrics and overviews can come directly from companies, from government filings, from news reports, or from any other knowledgeable party. If you know some material that should be here (a webpage, a file, or even original text), you can [[/new/Source | add a new Source]].</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h1>More Transparency</h1>\r\n<p>It's great to gather all the available data about [[Companies]].  It's even better to <strong>get [[Companies]] to gather and publish data that currently isn't available</strong> at all.</p>\r\n<p>Individual WikiRate community members have a wide array opinions about how companies should behave, and therefore <strong>WikiRate as a whole seeks to take a neutral stance on how it reports behavior.  However, we take a strong stance in favor of transparency</strong>.  Without corporate transparency, we cannot gather the information we need to assess corporate behavior in any domain.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, <strong>we are in the process of implementing a [[Transparency Score|Transparency Score]]</strong> that will measure how well a company is making available the information that the WikiRate community considers most important.  In this way we hope to reward companies for transparency and give them an incentive to provide the data needed to assess their social and environmental performance.</p>\r\n<p><span>All WikiRate [[Overview]] and [[Metrics]] will be freely available to anyone, and we will actively support their reuse.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h1>Make Companies Accountable</h1>\r\n<p><strong>Ultimately, the goal of WikiRate is to make companies accountable to their stakeholders:</strong> the people who live near them, buy from them, work for them, or are otherwise affected by their decisions.  The vision of WikiRate is not scolding companies, it's helping them to improve.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://WikiRate.org\">WikiRate.org</a> does not impose a preconceived definition of \"ethical\" upon companies or other community members.  Instead, it invites its community to convey what they find \"important\" and bases the dynamics of the site upon what its members say.  When a member says a [[Topic]] is important (via up-voting or drag-and-drop), for example, this affects the order in which Topics are displayed.  When a member says a [[Note]] is important, this affects how a citation is visualized in an [[Overview]].  And, most relevantly, when a member says a [[Metric]] is important, that affects a company's [[Transparency Score|Transparency Score]] and nudges companies to provide more information on that Metric.</p>\r\n<p>As the WikiRate community grows, we expect that its [[Overview]] and [[Metrics]] will become a more and more important source of information about companies.<span> It will be used by consumers to determine who is worthy of their purchases. </span><span>It will be used by investors to determine who is worthy of their investments. And <strong><a href=\"http://Wikirate.org\">Wikirate.org</a> will be used by companies themselves to understand how they are performing, how they are perceived, and how they can improve both</strong>.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h1>The WikiRate Community</h1>\r\n<p><strong>Wikirate is for everyone who cares about how company behavior affects people and their environment.</strong></p>\r\n<p>We're not an advocacy site, but we welcome advocacy group representatives to [[/new/:signup|join]], add [[Sources]], create [[Metrics]], run data [[Project]], and otherwise participate in gathering and making sense of data related to issues that concern them.</p>\r\n<p>We're not a corporate mouthpiece, but we welcome company representatives to [[/new/:signup|join]], add [[Sources]], populate [[Metrics]], and generally engage in explaining the company's impacts and the choices it makes.</p>\r\n<p>We're not all experts – most of us are learning as we go.  But we are working together to break the <span>enormous task of monitoring companies into small tasks.</span></p>\r\n<p><span></span>If you [[/new/:signup|join our community]] (it's free!), you can add new [[sources]], edit [[Overview]], evaluate [[Note]], or fix [[fix things!|typos and other errors]]. <span>One of the easiest ways to get started is to join a [[Project]], which is a way of focusing community attention on a specific topic or data challenge. However you choose to get involved, please know that your efforts are appreciated.  <strong>With your help, we can</strong></span><strong><span> create</span></strong><strong> a much-needed global resource for making companies clear</strong><span>.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>[[Company|Browse Companies]] </strong>|<strong> [[Topics|Browse Topics]] </strong>| <strong>[[Project|Browse Project]] </strong></p>"
